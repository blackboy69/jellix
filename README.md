## Installation
You can either use docker, or manually run it.

### Docker
An `API_URL` environment variable is required with the value being the address to your Jellyfin server, including trailing slash (`http://localhost:5000/`, for example).
An example docker-compose file:
```
services:
  jellix:
    image: ghcr.io/doihaveto/jellix
    container_name: jellix
    restart: unless-stopped 
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://localhost:5000/
      - PORT=80 #optional, change internal service port
    ports:
      - 3000:80
```

This will run Jellix on port 3000.

### Manual
This project is composed entirely of static files. All that it requires is a web server. First, edit `code/params.js` to your Jellyfin server, including trailing slash (`http://localhost:5000/`, for example). After that you can either deliver this project as a static directory via nginx or some other web server, or you can spin one your own with python by running `python -m http.server 3000` in the `code` directory, which you can then access via http://localhost:3000/
